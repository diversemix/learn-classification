#### Topics Covered:
1. What is Text Classification?
2. Applications of Text Classification
3. Challenges in Text Classification

#### Lesson Plan:
1. **What is Text Classification?**
   - Definition: Text classification is the process of assigning predefined categories to text documents.
   - Examples: Spam detection in emails, sentiment analysis in social media, topic categorization in news articles.

2. **Applications of Text Classification**
   - Spam Detection: Automatically identifying and filtering out spam emails.
   - Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text (positive, negative, neutral).
   - Topic Categorization: Classifying news articles or research papers by topics or themes.
   - Customer Service: Routing customer inquiries to the appropriate department.

3. **Challenges in Text Classification**
   - Handling large and diverse datasets.
   - Dealing with noisy and unstructured data.
   - Managing imbalanced datasets where some categories are underrepresented.
   - Ensuring model interpretability and fairness.

### Lesson 2: Preparing the Data

**Objective:** Learn how to clean and preprocess text data, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

#### Topics Covered:
1. Understanding the Corpus
2. Cleaning and Preprocessing Text Data
3. Tokenization and Vectorization
4. Splitting the Dataset

#### Lesson Plan:
1. **Understanding the Corpus**
   - Analyze the structure and content of the corpus.
   - Example: A collection of movie reviews from the IMDb dataset.

   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset

   dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
   print(dataset['train'][0])
   ```

2. **Cleaning and Preprocessing Text Data**
   - Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters.
   - Converting text to lowercase.
   - Removing stop words (common words that add little value).

   ```python
   import re
   import nltk
   from nltk.corpus import stopwords

   nltk.download('stopwords')
   stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

   def preprocess_text(text):
       text = re.sub(r'\W', ' ', text)  # Remove punctuation
       text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)  # Remove extra spaces
       text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
       text = ' '.join([word for word in text.split() if word not in stop_words])  # Remove stopwords
       return text

   # Apply preprocessing to the dataset
   dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: {'text': preprocess_text(x['text'])})
   ```

3. **Tokenization and Vectorization**
   - Tokenization: Splitting text into words or tokens.
   - Vectorization: Converting text into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF).

   ```python
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

   # Convert dataset to list
   train_texts = [x['text'] for x in dataset['train']]
   train_labels = [x['label'] for x in dataset['train']]

   vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
   X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_texts)

   print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
   print(X_train.toarray())
   ```

4. **Splitting the Dataset**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_train, train_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
